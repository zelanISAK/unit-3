# 2. Object-Oriented Programming

## Introduction
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

### Main Concepts of OOPs
* Class 
* Objects
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Data Abstraction

## Objects, Classes, Attributes, and Methods
**Example**: 
I like painting and I use a Sakura Koi Pocket Field Watercolor Kit. 

**In OOP terms**: 
The Sakura Koi Pocket Field Watercolor Kit is an Object (an instance) of the class *Palettes* which is a subclass of the class *Watercolor*, which is a subclass of the class *Painting Mediums*, and this one is a subclass of the class *Visual Art Mediums*.

**Attributes** 
* Brand 
* Colors
* Paint Type (Gouache, Acrylic, Chalk)
* Storage Type (Pan, Tube)
* Pigment
* Transparency
* Permanence
* Quality Type (Artist/Premium Quality, Student Quality)
