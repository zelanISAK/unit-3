# Unit 3. Expenses Tracker App for Ms. Emmy Abella 


# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem Definition

Emmy Abella Domingues is an 18-year-old IB Year 1 student from Brazil. As an international & boarding student in UWC ISAK Japan, money management is a major aspect of her life. Although Emmy easily keep tracks of her income or cash inflow, she finds it hard to keep track of her expenses. Specifically, she finds it difficult to note what, when, and how much she spends on. In addition, she finds it hard to visualize how large her purchases are since she spends in a currency (Japanese Yen - Â¥) different to what she's used to (Brazilian Real - R$). The client, Emmy Domingues, is in need of an app that keeps track of her expenses. In addition, the client requires the app to be encrypted through a login system, for the data to be stored in a database, and for the user interface to be clear, concise, and most importantly attractive by using the client's favorite color, pink.


## // Rationale for Proposed Solution
- The rationale behind the choice of the proposed product must be in extended writing justifying how the choice of proposed product must be in extended writing justifying how the choice of this particular product is an effective solution.
- Why is an app needed?
- What are included in the app?
- What are used in the development in the app



## Success Criteria
1. The solution is an application that provides a presentation of the user's expenses in a tabular format.
2. The application is able to add, edit, or delete entries to the app's database and present these changes.
3. The application is kept secure by embedding a log in system and a registration system to add users.
4. The user's data of expenses are stored in a SQLLite database.
5. The application is up to the user's visual standard by using only shades of the user's favorite color, pink.
6. The user's expenses are categorized into Food, Transportation, Emergency & Healthcare, Leisure, and Miscellaneous. 
7. The app logs the date of purchase based on user input, and allows the user to write a 20-character note about that expense as an option.
