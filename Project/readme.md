# Unit 3. Expenses Tracker App for Ms. Emmy Abella 


# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem Definition

Emmy Abella Domingues is an 18-year-old IB Year 1 student from Brazil. As an international & boarding student in UWC ISAK Japan, money management is a major aspect of her life. Although Emmy easily keep tracks of her income or cash inflow, she finds it hard to keep track of her expenses. Specifically, she finds it difficult to note what, when, and how much she spends on.

The client, Emmy Domingues, is in need of an app that keeps track of her expenses. In addition, the client requires the app to be encrypted through a login system, for the data to be stored in a database, and for the user interface to be clear, concise, and most importantly attractive by using the client's favorite color, pink.


## Rationale for Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an expense tracking application that allows users to keep track of their expenses, categorize them into the client's main expenditure type (Food, Transportation, Emergency & Healthcare, Leisure, and Miscellaneous), and monitor their spending. The app is necessary for people who want to stay on top of their finances and make informed financial decisions. The app provides users with a comprehensive overview of their spending habits, which is crucial for budgeting, planning, and saving.

The app includes a login & register system to provide an added layer of security by ensuring that only authorized users can access the app and its data. It also ensures that the user's data is private and personal to the authorized user, protecting sensitive information such as financial data, personal details, and transaction history. The user interface uses a color scheme that only includes colors in the shade of pink, as per request of the client. The interface is clear, concise, and attractive, making it easy for users to navigate and use the app. The app allows the user to add entries as the expense tracking app's basic functionality. In addition, it allows users to edit and delete entries just in case the user inputs an entry wrongly the first time.

The developer shall use Python, a popular programming language widely used in the development of web applications, scientific computing, and data analysis. The developer chose Python as it is a versatile language that is easy to learn and has a large community of developers who contribute to its development. Along with Python is kivyMD, a Python-based library use for developing user interfaces. The developer chose kivyMD because it is open source and it is a popular choice for app development among the Python developers community, due to its apparent simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. kivyMD provides a wide range of widgets, animations, and effects, making it easy to develop attractive and responsive user interfaces. Lastly, SQLite is chosen for the application's database management system due to its simplicity, reliability, and portability. SQLite offers a lightweight database management system and can be integrated with Python. SQLite is also scalable, meaning it can handle large amounts of data and is suitable for developing an expense tracking app. It is self-contained thus a separate server is not required.

In summary, the proposed solution is an expense tracking app that is necessary for people who want to stay on top of their finances. The app includes a login system, a database management system, a user interface, expense tracking, encryption, and personalization. Python, kivyMD, and SQLite are the best choices for developing the app because of their simplicity, flexibility, and reliability.

## Success Criteria
1. The solution is an application that provides a presentation of the user's expenses in a tabular format.
2. The application is able to add, edit, or delete entries to the app's database and present these changes. Each entry stores the date automatically, the amount spent, and the category of the expense.
3. The data table automatically converts the JPY amount to BZR to enable the user to visualize how much she spent in the currency she is used in.
3. The application is kept secure by embedding a log in system and a registration system to add users.
4. The user's data of expenses are stored in a SQLLite database.
5. The application is up to the user's visual standard by using only shades of the user's favorite color, pink.
6. The user's expenses are categorized into Food, Transportation, Emergency, Leisure, and Others.

|   | Plan the wireframe for the proposed solution: 'spent.io'. The wireframe includes 3 screens: Login Screen, Registration Screen, and Main Screen. This wireframe plan must include the widgets to be shown, components (ex. Dialog, MDButton), dimensions of each screens, components, and color schemes. This must also outline the transition from one screen to another and how this is done. More importantly, the planned wireframe must align with the client's success criteria. |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |               |                        |          |
