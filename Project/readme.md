## Problem Definition

Emmy Abella Domingues is an 18-year-old IB Year 1 student from Brazil. As an international & boarding student in UWC ISAK Japan, money management is a major aspect of her life. Although Emmy easily keep tracks of her income or cash inflow, she finds it hard to keep track of her expenses. Specifically, she finds it difficult to note what, when, and how much she spends on. In addition, she finds it hard to visualize how large her purchases are since she spends in a currency (Japanese Yen - Â¥) different to what she's used to (Brazilian Real - R$). The client, Emmy Domingues, is in need of an app that keeps track of her expenses, shows important statistics, and a built-in currency converter to help her visualize & rationalize these purchases in Brazilian Real. In addition, the client requires the app to be encrypted through a login system, for the data to be stored in a database, and for the user interface to be clear, concise, and most importantly attractive by using the client's favorite color, pink.
