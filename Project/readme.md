## Problem Definition

Emmy Abella Domingues is an 18-year-old IB Year 1 student from Brazil. As an international & boarding student in UWC ISAK Japan, money management is a major aspect of her life. Although Emmy easily keep tracks of her income or cash inflow, she finds it hard to keep track of her expenses. Specifically, she finds it difficult to note what, when, and how much she spends on. In addition, she finds it hard to visualize how large her purchases are since she spends in a currency (Japanese Yen - ¥) different to what she's used to (Brazilian Real - R$). The client, Emmy Domingues, is in need of an app that keeps track of her expenses, shows important statistics, and a built-in currency converter to help her visualize & rationalize these purchases in Brazilian Real. In addition, the client requires the app to be encrypted through a login system, for the data to be stored in a database, and for the user interface to be clear, concise, and most importantly attractive by using the client's favorite color, pink.

Considering the client requirements, an adequate solution requires an app

"""
Considering the client requirements an adequate solution includes a low cost sensing device for humidity and temperature and a custom data script that process and anaysis the samples acquired. For a low cost sensing device an adequate alternative is the DHT11 sensor1 which is offered online for less than 5 USD and provides adequare precision and range for the client requirements (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). Similar devices such as the DHT22, AHT20 or the AM2301B 2 have higher specifications, however the DHT11 uses a simple serial communication (SPI) rather than more eleborated protocols such as the I2C used by the alternatives. For the range, precision and accuracy required in this applicaiton the DHT11 provides the best compromise. Connecting the DHT11 sensor to a computer requires a device that provides a Serial Port communication. A cheap and often used alternative for prototyping is the Arduino UNO microcontroller 3. "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software"4. In additon to the low cost of the Arduino (< 6USD), this devide is programable and expandable1. Other alternatives include diffeerent versions of the original Arduino but their size and price make them a less adequate solution.

Considering the budgetary constrains of the client and the hardware requirements, the software tool that I proposed for this solution is Python. Python is open source, it is mature and supported in mutiple platforms (platform-independent) including macOS, Windows, Linux and can also be used to program the Arduino microprocessor 56. In comparison to the alternative C or C++, which share similar features, Python is a High level programming language (HLL) with high abstraction 7. For example, memory management is automatic in Python whereas it is responsability of the C/C++ developer to allocate and free up memory 7, this could result in faster applications but also memory problems. In addition a HLL language will allow me and future developers extend the solution or solve issues proptly.
